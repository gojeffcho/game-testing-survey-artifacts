Focus testing was done to observe player behaviors as they played through the game, or a specific aspect of the game, and to interview players to get deeper thoughts on what was working well/what wasn't.

UX research was reached out to if a survey was needed for the test, which was also handed off to QA to distribute. This was done on a weekly basis, with specific goal needs becoming more important and more prominent in testing towards our release dates.

We leaned pretty heavily on automation to provide the bulk of the testing work load with a small (for AAA) internal team dedicated largely to embedded testing within feature teams and for daily build validation on shipping builds. There was a heavy expectation on developers to write tests for their work up front and we had regular reviews of the automated tests to ensure we were getting the right coverage (our automated tests came in a wide range of forms and ranged from pretty typical unit tests to more extensive bootflow, performance, scale and visual tests).    We were also testing new versions of the game with the community at a regular cadence - initially just for short sessions in the early days moving to weekly and the 24/7 testing.

Typically testing was a daily activity from the very first version of the game and testing planning broke down into the following areas:   - feature testing planning (i.e. how are features testing while in development)   - build validation planning (i.e. what tests need to be done to ensure that the current shipping version of the game is good to release)   - automation planning (i.e. what automated test suites do we need, what upkeep do we need to do on them and what additional testing capabilities should we invest in next)   - compliance test planning   - compatibility test planning   - localisation test planning   - accessibility test planning    For some of the latter, we had partners that we worked with to come up with the plans required but they were part of the same organisation as us for the most part.   -   ",Strongly Agree,Somewhat Agree,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,Strongly Disagree,Somewhat Agree,Somewhat Disagree,Somewhat Disagree,Somewhat Disagree,This is a difficult question to answer because our goals for testing were pretty wide ranging (from experiential testing with the community to very stringent technical testing) but largely the testing process was very successful for the most part.

The drawback, we found, was that it would re-download our binary content from Git LFS every time it ran, resulting in unsustainable costs once the development team grew large enough. Unity Cloud Diagnostics was also used once the project was given to a random assortment of users in early access. The major benefit here was getting automated, detailed reports of issues that otherwise wouldn't have been possible with manual reporting from this population.

Maintaining testing strategies and updating them as a project evolves takes time and resources that could go toward some other aspect of development. I think, with a larger team, that cost becomes easier to justify since it has an additive effect for every developer who's trying to integrate their work.","I would like to see some new automated build tools - something that doesn't clone a repository fresh from scratch every time it runs would be nice. I would also like to run automated performance tests on given sample scenes on a wide range of hardware (real, preferably, but simulated would be fine too).

We have documented process flows, usage flows.  Which are prevalidated by the QA team.  So our main user focus is purely usability, multiplayer sync, data sync type issues.    We omitted CI/CD, and Unit Testing.  In past experience, both can turn into make work projects for some projects - and weren't needed for this particular project.  We stopped using all three of these for any project shorter than 2 years.    We instead require the initial project team to define the base requirements checked throughout QA (base feature usage and workflow).    Our developers then complete their tickets in an agile method, and are responsible for submitting a build to our QA with a test plan to validate their performed work.    Finally the user biweekly game tests validate that the game is meeting our requirements.  Our focus here is not just bug fixes and general QA, but observing UX and game flow.  A lot of UX lessons we've learned for VR titles are not well documented and define our projects in cross industry.    We do have some checklists that have come out of past UX which are routinely validated but very difficult to unit test.  For example, all user input systems need to address all three core learning styles we focus on (kinetic, visual, audio).  Meaning vibrations, popups, and voice overs.    It also requires other UX requirements such as minimizing text (due to low resolution of some VR headsets), accessibility options such as our colour blind support, and the ability to display controller buttons in VR at all times.  We consider someone failing at a game due to the controls the fault of our company, failing at the game because someone plays better than them is what we want.  These outcomes and cause/effects are documented.    This is very different from games of ours such as Cultivate, which is a 3 year game with a much higher budget and much bigger team.  However Cultivate is still finishing development and so could not be included in this survey.",Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,"We didn't include any automation for testing.    Testing was only manual for this title.  Strong visual titles dependant heavily on physics simulations and network states is notoriously difficult to create unit tests for.  As a result, I often find the work to creat the unit tests and adjusting them is usually far more (4 to 5x) what we see with manual testing.  And manual testing needs to be performed and documented anyway for both UX and for our marketing teams.    Unit testing can be valuable for common function testing, just as JSON structures, or basic math formula exchanges.  However most of this in/out style coding is now baked into the engines and less required for testing.  It is assumed, for example, what multiplying 2 vectors would produce.  It needs testing however to see how two complex colliders would interact with a live network feed running slow for one player.  Most of the transactional programming methodologies don't benefit from automated testing and are more effective to just have the pull requests peer reviewed for a project this size.    I'm very open to revising this over the course of this year, but haven't yet as we've just been overhwelmed with projects.

Functionality is not well tested beyond basic use however, and it requires very careful management of unity engine versions.  We have specific versions we use that have cleared our testing and been battle tested by us in the past.  Lately we've been moving more to Unreal, more for ethical reasons, but also improvement of visual quality.    nUnit for basic unit tests but mostly unused.  This is built into Unity, but doesn't do well with testing existing game states and mostly works on basic in/out functions (which are a lot less common in games these days as this functionality is built into the engines).  Also, as games are moving towards node based programming, this becomes less valuable for programmers and becomes more built into the engines.    Blender/Modo/Maya, Substance, Rokoko mocap & Adobe suite - creation of all models and assets.  This is mostly expensive and requires two stage reviews for ensuring all the models and animations look right and scale right and light properly.    VRTK - an open source VR framework.  This has been heavily modified by our team as it allows us to create mobile, VR, desktop and web games all in one.  VRTK is not well funded or supported these days, but was one of the only functional cross headset frameworks.      Finally we used twitch for live UA testing.    And we used our QA document process, it's literally just a form.  We have our QA led by non technical folks, so getting a PDF QA form makes it ideal for them to print, play and test.  We also do things such as hiring Blackfoot youth etc for our QA, and some of our key QA members at the time had limited network access and not strong knowledge of complex web tools.

","Less focus on Unit Testing in of itself and better automated testing tied to actual functionality.  As we move to no-code graph based scripts, it becomes easy to tie in both unit testing for those but also to define a Unit test along side a complex function.  I'd like to see testing baked into systems clearer.  We we are moving away from Unity and more to Unreal, we expect our testing format to change considerably.  And we are likely to reintegrate CI/CD this year for larger projects.  But it's difficult to control a 20GB project full if complex assets, states, ML, AI, and phsycis systems and randomized rendering systems.  I'm not sure if our process is the right one but it places the users actual experience first and works for us for the time being"

Black box testing is a waste of time.  i.e. on an adjacent project the games were so long we always playthrough tested them at 5x game speed.   If it doesn't break at 5x, then it'll work fine at 1x.    Hardware distribution should account for hardware expectations of the end product.   Use Test kits that don't have the extra memory and PC configurations.      Build hardware libraries to shared peripherals, monitor types, and graphic cards.  QA needs to isolate specific tech issues but developers need the same hardware to develop a fix for them too.    Resource planning and allocation was planned and revised monthly and hiring fairs to bring in the right testers were done.   Take testing seriously and not say its just for anyone.

We should be taking more effort on testing ""fun"" as long as what functional is confirmed."
